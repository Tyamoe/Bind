# Binds
Binds is a application made in Java that allows you to create a keyboard shortcut that when pressed types a previously saved string of text.

Binds copies the users text to the clipboard then uses Java's Robot class to paste the text. The UI is built using JavaFX while key 
detection is done using JNativeHook.
